# 👋 Hi, I'm Monika Bengi  
💻 Web Developer | 🌸 Creative Thinker | 🌍 Based in the UK  

I’ve recently completed my **Web Development course with Pitman Training**,  
in collaboration with **Tech Academy**, where I gained hands-on experience  
in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.  

Now I’m focusing on improving my JavaScript and Bootstrap skills while building real-world projects  
and preparing for my upcoming **Software Development** course.

### 💡 About Me
I’m passionate about creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites.  
I love learning new things every day, solving design problems, and adding a little creativity to every project.  
Every project I create is a reflection of who I am — a mum, a dreamer, and someone who believes that small details can make something truly special.
